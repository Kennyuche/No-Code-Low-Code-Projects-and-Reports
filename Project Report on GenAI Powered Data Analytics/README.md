# AI-Powered Collections Strategy (Agentic AI)

## Overview
This project presents a **high-level design of an AI-powered debt collections system** that leverages **Agentic AI with human oversight** to improve delinquency detection, automate early interventions, and optimize recovery outcomes in a fair and scalable way.

The proposed system is designed for a financial services environment (Geldium) to enhance both **operational efficiency and customer experience**.

---

## Problem Addressed
Traditional debt collection processes are often:
- Reactive instead of proactive  
- Costly to scale  
- Inconsistent in customer treatment  

This solution introduces an **AI-driven, risk-based approach** to detect early signs of delinquency and trigger the right actions at the right time.

---

## Solution Summary
The proposed system:
- Ingests customer, financial, credit, and repayment data  
- Predicts delinquency risk using AI  
- Classifies customers into low, medium, and high risk  
- Triggers automated reminders or agent intervention based on risk level  
- Continuously learns from customer responses to improve performance  

Human agents remain responsible for **high-impact and sensitive decisions**.

## Responsible AI
The solution is built with:
- Bias and fairness controls  
- Transparent, explainable risk scoring  
- Human-in-the-loop governance  
- Regulatory and data privacy safeguards

## Expected Impact
- Reduced new delinquency cases  
- Improved early-stage recoveries  
- Lower operational costs  
- Better agent workload prioritization  
- More consistent and fair customer engagement
